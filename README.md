# HooglandCheckers

Hello,
This was a project for a University CS Course. The game is simple, it follows original rules of Draughts, but it has a special rule where a King can attack another King. If a Man can attack another man, It is obligated to attack. Whenever a Man reaches the other end of the board, that Man transforms into a King. It was invented by Herman Hoogland (Netherlands) in 1923.

! My project is not complete, as it does not follow every Draughts Rule, as I have no more time to complete it !

The Game Features the ability to play VS Player or VS Computer.

The Computer has two difficulties: Easy and Medium (Not Implemented Yet). The Medium difficulty will consist of the Computer using the Minimax Algorithm alongside Alpha-Beta Pruning.
